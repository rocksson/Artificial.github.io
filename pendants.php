  Alphabet designed gold pendants and pendants which are shape of names, are worn by people nowadays. Initials of a person are carved, even studded with diamonds. They are a perfect gift for your loved ones.<br>Pendants of gold, having shapes of a sharp, magnificent anchor, are different and creative. They symbolize strength and support in a way. Sometimes these pendants have a rope like a pattern around the anchor, which makes it more remarkably glitzy.<br>Royal and beautiful, gold pendants are attractively stylised. That ravishingly lovely, small bulk of jewelry, slid into a chain, to occupy the middle space, floating close to the sternum, is called a pendant. This ornament is very delicate, shines like a scintillating star around the neck. The elegantly sleek chain accommodating the pendant highlights the alluring collar bones of the woman who adorns it. Pendants give a very feminine look and the neck appears to be slimmer. Overall, the ornament looks very simple but classy.
